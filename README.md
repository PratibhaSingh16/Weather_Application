### I used data from [Weather Api](http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=cincinnati&appid=8cddb2ca0d7be9d0273f2593e0a3cfb0) and used my Python skill to come up with Weather Application which will let you find the weather of your desired location in one click, and for that convenience I used Text Field, so that you can enter your location name. Codes used here are available in this repository.
### I have also attched few screenshots of the places I searched, so this will gives you a glance of the application. Have a look:
